Abstract:

This paper explores the defining qualities of language that are considered influential and charismatic in the context of po- litical speech. Transformer-based models have shown to be efficient in analyzing contextual clues and generating coher- ent texts in a variety of domains. With limited research in the identification and exploration of the replication of persua- sion in natural human language and generation of influential speech, we seek to analyze the aspects of public speech that are deemed persuasive and impactful, and generate text ac- cordingly. We propose a two-part experiment: First, we train a BERT-based encoder to weigh segments of speech in or- der to predict its influence on an audience; second, we train a GPT-based decoder to use an established understanding of persuasion to generate new political speech. We show that, using these models, a speech can be created that mimics the natural language habits of prominent political figures.
